_My journey through the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) programming puzzles_

</div>

## 📖 About

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an annual set of Christmas-themed programming challenges that follow an Advent calendar. Each day unlocks a new puzzle with two parts, designed to be solved in any programming language.

This repository contains my solutions using **Python**, complete with interactive visualizers built with **PyQt6** to bring the puzzles to life!

## 🗂️ Repository Structure

Each day follows a consistent structure:

```
day_X/
├── part1.py          # Solution for Part 1
├── part2.py          # Solution for Part 2
├── input.txt         # Puzzle input
├── example_in.txt    # Example test case (if applicable)
└── visualizer.py     # Interactive PyQt6 visualization (if applicable)
```

## 🎮 Running the Solutions

### Prerequisites

```bash
pip install PyQt6
```

### Run Solutions

```bash
# Navigate to a specific day
cd day_1

# Run part 1
python part1.py

# Run part 2
python part2.py

# Launch the visualizer
python visualizer.py
```

## 🎨 Visualizers

Some puzzles include interactive GUI visualizers that demonstrate the solution process step-by-step:

- **Step-by-step execution** - Watch the algorithm work in real-time
- **Speed controls** - Adjust animation speed or step through manually
- **Visual feedback** - See the problem and solution visually represented
- **Play/Pause/Reset** - Full control over the visualization


## 📊 Progress

| Day | Part 1 | Part 2 | Visualizer |
| --- | ------ | ------ | ---------- |
| 1   | ⭐     | ⭐     | ✅         |
| 2   | ⭐     | ⭐     | ✅         |
| 3   | ⭐     | ⭐     | ✅         |
| ... | ...    | ...    | ...        |

_⭐ = Completed | ✅ = Has Visualizer | ❌ = No Visualizer_

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python 3.8+** - Core programming language
- **PyQt6** - GUI framework for visualizers
- **Algorithms** - Dynamic programming, graph traversal, optimization, etc.

## 💡 Learning Goals

- Strengthen problem-solving skills
- Explore different algorithmic approaches
- Create visual representations of complex problems
- Write clean, maintainable code

## 📝 Notes

Solutions prioritize clarity and correctness over performance optimization. Each puzzle is an opportunity to learn something new!
